"In ``[program:x]`` sections, the keys ``logfile``, ``logfile_backups``, "
"``logfile_maxbytes``, ``log_stderr`` and ``log_stdout`` are no longer "
"valid.  Supervisor2 logged both stderr and stdout to a single log file.  "
"Supervisor 3 logs stderr and stdout to separate log files.  You'll need "
"to rename ``logfile`` to ``stdout_logfile``, ``logfile_backups`` to "
"``stdout_logfile_backups``, and ``logfile_maxbytes`` to "
"``stdout_logfile_maxbytes`` at the very least to preserve your "
"configuration.  If you created program sections where ``log_stderr`` was "
"true, to preserve the behavior of sending stderr output to the stdout "
"log, use the ``redirect_stderr`` boolean in the program section instead."

":program:`supervisorctl`) to work properly:"

"The semantics of the ``autorestart`` parameter within ``[program:x]`` "
"sections has changed.  This parameter used to accept only ``true`` or "
"``false``.  It now accepts an additional value, ``unexpected``, which "
"indicates that the process should restart from the ``EXITED`` state only "
"if its exit code does not match any of those represented by the "
"``exitcode`` parameter in the process' configuration (implying a process "
"crash).  In addition, the default for ``autorestart`` is now "
"``unexpected`` (it used to be ``true``, which meant restart "
"unconditionally)."

msgid ""
"We now allow :program:`supervisord` to listen on both a UNIX domain "
"socket and an inet socket instead of making listening on one mutually "
"exclusive with listening on the other.  As a result, the options "
"``http_port``, ``http_username``, ``http_password``, ``sockchmod`` and "
"``sockchown`` are no longer part of the ``[supervisord]`` section "
"configuration. These have been supplanted by two other sections: "
"``[unix_http_server]`` and ``[inet_http_server]``.  You'll need to insert"
" one or the other (depending on whether you want to listen on a UNIX "
"domain socket or a TCP socket respectively) or both into your "
":file:`supervisord.conf` file.  These sections have their own options "
"(where applicable) for ``port``, ``username``, ``password``, ``chmod``, "
"and ``chown``."

"All supervisord command-line options related to ``http_port``, "
"``http_username``, ``http_password``, ``sockchmod`` and ``sockchown`` "

"The option that used to be ``sockchown`` within the ``[supervisord]`` "
"section (and is now named ``chown`` within the ``[unix_http_server]`` "
"section) used to accept a dot-separated (``user.group``) value.  The "
"separator now must be a colon, e.g. ``user:group``.  Unices allow for "
"dots in usernames, so this change is a bugfix."
