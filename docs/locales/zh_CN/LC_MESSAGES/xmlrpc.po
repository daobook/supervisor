"Supervisor can be extended with new XML-RPC APIs.  Several third-party "
"plugins already exist that can be wired into your Supervisor "
"configuration.  You may additionally write your own.  Extensible XML-RPC "
"interfaces is an advanced feature, introduced in version 3.0. You needn't"
" understand it unless you wish to use an existing third-party RPC "
"interface plugin or if you wish to write your own RPC interface plugin."

"This section *must* remain in the configuration for the standard setup of"

"However, if you wish to add additional XML-RPC interface namespaces to a "
"configuration of supervisor, you may add additional "
"``[rpcinterface:foo]`` sections, where \"foo\" represents the namespace "
"of the interface (from the web root), and the value named by "
"``supervisor.rpcinterface_factory`` is a factory callable written in "
"Python which should have a function signature that accepts a single "
"positional argument ``supervisord`` and as many keyword arguments as "
"required to perform configuration.  Any key/value pairs defined within "
"the ``rpcinterface:foo`` section will be passed as keyword arguments to "
"the factory.  Here's an example of a factory function, created in the "
"package ``my.package``."
