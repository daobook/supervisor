"Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to control a "
"number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.  It was inspired by "
"the following:"
msgstr ""
"Supervisor 是客户端/服务器系统，允许用户在类 UNIX 操作系统上控制多个进程。"
"它的灵感来源于以下几点："

"It is often inconvenient to need to write ``rc.d`` scripts for every "
"single process instance.  ``rc.d`` scripts are a great lowest-common-"
"denominator form of process initialization/autostart/management, but they"
" can be painful to write and maintain.  Additionally, ``rc.d`` scripts "
"cannot automatically restart a crashed process and many programs do not "
"restart themselves properly on a crash.  Supervisord starts processes as "
"its subprocesses, and can be configured to automatically restart them on "
"a crash.  It can also automatically be configured to start processes on "
"its own invocation."
msgstr ""
"通常需要写 ``rc.d`` 脚本用于每个单个流程实例是不方便的。"
"``rc.d`` 脚本是进程初始化/自动启动/管理的一种极好的最低公分母形式，但它们的编写和维护可能非常痛苦。"
"此外，``rc.d`` 脚本不能自动重新启动崩溃的进程，许多程序在崩溃时不能正确地重新启动自己。"
"supervisor 将进程作为它的子进程启动，可以配置为在崩溃时自动重启它们。"
"它还可以被自动配置为在自己调用时启动进程。"

msgid "Accuracy"
msgstr "精度"

#: ../../introduction.rst:26
msgid ""
"It's often difficult to get accurate up/down status on processes on UNIX."
"  Pidfiles often lie.  Supervisord starts processes as subprocesses, so "
"it always knows the true up/down status of its children and can be "
"queried conveniently for this data."
msgstr ""
"在 UNIX 上准确地获取进程的 up/down 状态通常是很困难的。"
"pidfile 经常说谎。"
"supervise 以子进程的形式启动进程，因此它总是知道子进程的真实 up/down 状态，并且可以方便地查询这些数据。"

msgid ""
"Users who need to control process state often need only to do that. They "
"don't want or need full-blown shell access to the machine on which the "
"processes are running.  Processes which listen on \"low\" TCP ports often"
" need to be started and restarted as the root user (a UNIX misfeature).  "
"It's usually the case that it's perfectly fine to allow \"normal\" people"
" to stop or restart such a process, but providing them with shell access "
"is often impractical, and providing them with root access or sudo access "
"is often impossible.  It's also (rightly) difficult to explain to them "
"why this problem exists.  If supervisord is started as root, it is "
"possible to allow \"normal\" users to control such processes without "
"needing to explain the intricacies of the problem to them.  Supervisorctl"
" allows a very limited form of access to the machine, essentially "
"allowing users to see process status and control supervisord-controlled "
"subprocesses by emitting \"stop\", \"start\", and \"restart\" commands "
"from a simple shell or web UI."
msgstr ""
"需要控制进程状态的用户通常只需要这样做。"
"他们不希望或不需要对运行进程的机器进行完整的 shell 访问。"
"监听 \"low\" TCP 端口的进程通常需要作为根用户启动并重新启动（UNIX 的一个错误特性）。"
"通常情况下，允许 \"normal\" 用户停止或重新启动这样的进程是完全没问题的，"
"但为他们提供 shell 访问权限通常是不切实际的，而为他们提供根访问权限或 sudo 访问权限通常是不可能的。"
"向他们解释这个问题的存在也是很困难的。"
"如果 supervisor 以 root 用户的身份启动，就可以允许“普通”用户控制这些进程，而不需要向他们解释问题的复杂性。"
"Supervisorctl 允许对机器进行非常有限的访问，"
"本质上允许用户通过从简单的 shell 或 web UI 中发出 “stop”、“start” 和 “restart” "
"命令来查看进程状态和控制受监控的子进程。"

msgid ""
"Processes often need to be started and stopped in groups, sometimes even "
"in a \"priority order\".  It's often difficult to explain to people how "
"to do this.  Supervisor allows you to assign priorities to processes, and"
" allows user to emit commands via the supervisorctl client like \"start "
"all\", and \"restart all\", which starts them in the preassigned priority"
" order.  Additionally, processes can be grouped into \"process groups\" "
"and a set of logically related processes can be stopped and started as a "
"unit."
msgstr ""
"进程通常需要按组启动和停止，有时甚至需要按“优先顺序”。"
"通常很难向人们解释如何做到这一点。"
"Supervisor 允许你给进程分配优先级，并允许用户通过 supervisorctl 客户端发出命令，"
"比如 \"start all\" 和 \"restart all\"，它们按照预先分配的优先级顺序启动它们。"
"此外，进程可以被分组为“进程组”，一组逻辑上相关的进程可以作为一个单元停止和启动。"
